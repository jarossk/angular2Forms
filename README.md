# Forms Angular 2.0

A form creates a cohesive, effective, and compelling data entry experience. 
An Angular form coordinates a set of data-bound user controls, tracks changes, validates input, and presents errors.

The Angular 2 form discussed in this chapter takes advantage of the following framework features to provide support for data modification, validation and more:

  - An Angular HTML form template.
  - A form component class with a Component decorator.
  - The ngSubmit directive for handling the form submission.
  - Template local variables such as #heroForm, #name, #alter-ego and #power.
  - The ngModel directive for two-way data binding. 
  - The ngControl for validation and form element change tracking.
  - The local variableâ€™s valid property on input controls to check if a control is valid and show/hide error messages.
  - Controlling the submit button's enabled state by binding to NgForm validity.
  - Custom CSS classes that provide visual feedback to users about invalid controls.
